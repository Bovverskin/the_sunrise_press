Feature: Visitor can change language
    As a user
    In order to be able to read articles in my native language,
    I would like to switch between languages English and Swedish

    Background:
        Given the following category exists:
            | name    |
            | Culture |
            | Weather |

        And I visit the landing page

    Scenario: Visitor can see categories on index page
        Then I should see 'Culture'
        And I should see 'Weather'
        
    Scenario: Visitor can see categories in swedish language
        Given I click on 'Svenska'
        Then I should see 'Kultur'
        And I should see 'VÃ¤der'
